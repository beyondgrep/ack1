#  -bli    opening brace on new line and indented
#  -bar    opening brace always on right, even for long clauses
#  -vt=n   vertical tightness (requires -lp); n controls break after opening
#          token: 0=never  1=no break if next line balanced   2=no break

#          token starts new line: 0=always  1=not unless list  1=never
#  -wba=s  want break after tokens in string; i.e. wba=': .'
#  -wbb=s  want break before tokens in string
# 
# Following Old Breakpoints

#  -cab=n  break at commas after a comma-arrow (=>):
#          n=0 break at all commas after =>
#          n=1 stable: break unless this breaks an existing one-line container
#          n=2 break only if a one-line container cannot be formed

# 
# HTML
#  -html write an html file (see 'man perl2web' for many options)
#        Note: when -html is used, no indentation or formatting are done.
#        Hint: try perltidy -html -css=mystyle.css filename.pl
#        and edit mystyle.css to change the appearance of filename.html.
#        -nnn gives line numbers

#        -frm write html as a frame (3 files)
#        -text=s extra extension for table of contents if -frm, default='toc'
#        -sext=s extra extension for file content if -frm, default='src'
# 
# A prefix of "n" negates short form toggle switches, and a prefix of "no"
# negates the long forms.  For example, -nasc means don't add missing
# semicolons.
